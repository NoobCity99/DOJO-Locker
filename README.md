# DOJO-Locker
This is a password locker I created on a live stream on my youtube channel.  Just messing around with GPT5 and crypto in python. 

Named the app after a viewer DOJO. 

Password for the intial json if you download the app and the json, SHOULD be:  dojo

I've been coding for like 3 weeks... on git hub for 3 days... so apologies if I botch this whole thing
